Project Idea: Endangered Species
Website: https://www.fws.gov/endangered

I will track 3 species in Class Mammalia and Order Carnivora through time to understand the fluctuations in conservation status.

I'm interested in Red Pandas, Red Fox, Artic Wolf
I want to look at the population fluctuations in the past 5 decades and look at how the species adapted to habitat loss and modernization.
