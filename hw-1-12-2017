ls Reading Comprehension

Assuming a directory structure as in the above Figure (File System for Challenge Questions), if pwd displays /Users/backup, and -r tells ls to display things in reverse order, what command will display:

pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/

ls -r -F
ls -r -F /Users/backup

Exploring More ls Arguments

What does the command ls do when used with the -l and -h arguments?

The -l argument creates a long list format which not only shows what files are listed but the size of the files. The -h argument creates a human-readable form of this long list which converts the size files into a standard xx.xK form. 

Listing Recursively and By Time

The command ls -R lists the contents of directories recursively, i.e., lists their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on in alphabetical order at each level. The command ls -t lists things by time of last change, with most recently changed files or directories first. In what order does ls -R -t display things? Hint: ls -l uses a long listing format to view timestamps.

The directories are sorted alphabetical at each level, and the files within the directories are sorted by time of last change.
