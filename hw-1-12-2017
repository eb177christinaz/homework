ls Reading Comprehension

Assuming a directory structure as in the above Figure (File System for Challenge Questions), if pwd displays /Users/backup, and -r tells ls to display things in reverse order, what command will display:

pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/

ls -r -F
ls -r -F /Users/backup

Exploring More ls Arguments

What does the command ls do when used with the -l and -h arguments?

The -l argument creates a long list format which not only shows what files are listed but the size of the files. The -h argument creates a human-readable form of this long list which converts the size files into a standard xx.xK form.
